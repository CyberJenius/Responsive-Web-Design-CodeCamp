      <h1>Common Syntax</h1>
      <p> Some common syntax for Java that you may run into and see includes the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Class file_name</code> this is usually at the very top of a java file. It essentially forces the user to use Object Oriented programming by forcing the creation of a class</li>
        <li><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> is the default structure to start writing a "main" method within Java</li>
        <li><code>System.out.print()</code> or <code>System.out.println</code> which will print and print while creating a new line respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This in general is the basics to get started and create a simple "Hello World" file project"</p>
