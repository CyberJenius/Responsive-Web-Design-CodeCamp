      <p>
        Java is a very popular and common programming languages today. While it has been around since 1995, it has changed with multiple upgrades and interations. Java uses a compile-time system 
        for compiling code which makes catching errors and providing information about bugs easy. This can help with debugging and warriness of erros a vulnerabilities within applicaiton code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has been used for a variety of many different things. It was used to create videogames like Minecraft and Slay the Spire, but has also been used for other common applications like spotify.
        It is also used for creating things like web apps, cloud applications and scientific applications depending on the needs for these applications and the limits/expectations of this language
        compared to others.

      <h1>Common Syntax</h1>
      <p> Some common syntax for Java that you may run into and see includes the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Class file_name</code> this is usually at the very top of a java file. It essentially forces the user to use Object Oriented programming by forcing the creation of a class</li>
        <li><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> is the default structure to start writing a "main" method within Java</li>
        <li><code>System.out.print()</code> or <code>System.out.println</code> which will print and print while creating a new line respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This in general is the basics to get started and create a simple "Hello World" file project.</p>

      <h1>Data Types</h1>
      <p>
        Java is a static typed language which means that the user must assign all of the variables they create with the correct type. There are different specific scenarios and uses for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main data types in Java are listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>int</code> is an integer data type and can hold whole numbers</li>
        <li><code>String</code> is an string data type and can hold different strings of characters and spaces</li>
        <li><code>float</code> is an floating point number data type and can hold numbers with decimal numbers (<code>double</code> and <code>long</code> do the same but with higher maximum value/space requirements)</li>
        <li><code>char</code> is a character data type that can only hold a single letter</li>
        <li><code>boolean</code> is a true or false variable that can be used for logic</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id = "Variables" class = "main-section">
      <h1>Variables</h1>
      <p>Variables are values/references stored in memory that can be accessed and reused multiple times. When assigning a variable it will look something like this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code> int myNum = 5;</code></li>
        <li><code>String name = "Christopher";</code></li>
        <li><code>float myFloat = 1.6;</code></li>
        <li><code>char charOne= 'D';</code></li>
        <li><code>boolean myBoo = True;</code></li>
      </ul>
